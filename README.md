# Clubfund
Clubfund is a financial management application for university organizations built on Base.

Students and faculty are able to
- Create clubs and organizations
- Add administrators and treasurers
- Create and fund campaigns
- Expense and reimburse members within their organizations

This platform is especially useful for alumni, families, and friends who may want to contribute to university causes without going through the traditionally tedious process of campus finance offices.
